## Releasing a new version
To fully release a new version, you need to have access to the @materializecss organization on the npmjs. Then, please follow the steps below:

- In your local copy of Materialize, go into the dev Branch with `git checkout v2-dev` and pull the newest version
   with `git pull origin v2-dev` to have the newest version from the server. Run Tests and check if everything works.

- Create a new Release branch with `git checkout -b release-2.X.X`.
   In case something happens or needs to be changed during the release it is better to keep the release on its own branch.

- Run `npm version <change-type>`
   Where `<change-type> = patch, minor, major`. 
   [details](https://docs.npmjs.com/updating-your-published-package-version-number)

- Verify that the version is correctly replaced and files were generated in:
   * package.json
   * src/index.ts
   * dist/js
   * dist/css

- (Add Commit with message "chore: release 2.X.X-alpha")

- Push to server. `git push --tags`. Remember to push the tags aswell.

- Create a Pull Request (PR) into dev (dev <-- release-branch)

- Create a PR (main <-- dev)

- Merge the Pull Request if all checks pass and there were no concerns. (Set the draft release to public.)

- Create a new release on GitHub [New Release](https://github.com/materializecss/materialize/releases/new)
   * Select the tag from the pushed commit
   * Click "generate Release notes"
   * Upload the zip-files from the dist-folder.

- Checkout and pull main branch locally

- Publish the release on npmjs
   * If you never logged in on npm, please do `npm login` first and enter your credentials
   * Check with `npm publish --dry-run` if all files are included correctly (dist/js/*.js + sass files)
   * Then run `npm publish` and follow the instructions there
